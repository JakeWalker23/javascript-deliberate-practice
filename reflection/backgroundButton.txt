Reflection


+ What went well
- What went not well
* What could be improved next time



+ Learnt how to use Usestate

+ Applied a function to an event (onClick & mouseDown)

+ Made the training SPICE. Specific goal was met.

+ Actually turned up for training. Therefore I am better.

* Understanding of state. Who does state belong to?

* Better understanding of events

* Set the bar higher next time

+ Used React library (Draggable). Component was draggabled. 

- Did not read documentation of draggable. Reading docs is always key. 






Overall accomplished the task with focus. Small task but big achievement on the way to great things.
